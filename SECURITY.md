# Security Guide for Bookworld India

## üîê Immediate Security Actions Required

### 1. Credential Rotation (CRITICAL)

Your current credentials have been exposed and need to be rotated immediately:

#### MongoDB Atlas
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Navigate to your cluster
3. Click "Database Access" ‚Üí "Edit" on your user
4. Generate a new password
5. Update your `.env` file with the new credentials

#### Cloudinary
1. Go to [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console)
2. Navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "Security"
3. Regenerate your API Secret
4. Update your `.env` file with the new credentials

#### Email Service
1. Go to your email provider (Gmail, etc.)
2. Generate a new App Password
3. Update your `.env` file with the new password

### 2. Environment Configuration

#### Development Environment
```bash
# Copy the development template
cp config/env.development .env

# Update with your actual credentials
# Never commit the .env file
```

#### Production Environment
```bash
# Copy the production template
cp config/env.production .env

# Update with production credentials
# Use a secure secret management service
```

### 3. Secret Management

#### For Development
- Use the generated secrets from `scripts/generate-secrets.js`
- Store in `.env` file (already in .gitignore)

#### For Production
- Use cloud secret management services:
  - AWS Secrets Manager
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Google Secret Manager
  - HashiCorp Vault

### 4. Security Best Practices

#### Environment Variables
- ‚úÖ Use `.env` files for local development
- ‚úÖ Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Use environment-specific configs
- ‚úÖ Never commit secrets to version control
- ‚úÖ Use secure secret management in production

#### JWT Security
- ‚úÖ Use strong, random secrets (64+ characters)
- ‚úÖ Set appropriate expiration times
- ‚úÖ Use different secrets per environment
- ‚úÖ Implement refresh token rotation

#### Database Security
- ‚úÖ Use strong passwords
- ‚úÖ Enable IP whitelisting
- ‚úÖ Use connection pooling
- ‚úÖ Enable SSL/TLS connections

#### API Security
- ‚úÖ Implement rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Add input validation
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS in production
- ‚úÖ Implement CORS properly

### 5. Monitoring and Alerts

#### Set up monitoring for:
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Database connection issues
- File upload attempts
- Admin panel access

#### Recommended tools:
- Sentry for error tracking
- LogRocket for session replay
- DataDog for infrastructure monitoring
- AWS CloudWatch for AWS deployments

### 6. Regular Security Tasks

#### Weekly:
- Review access logs
- Check for failed login attempts
- Monitor API usage patterns

#### Monthly:
- Rotate secrets
- Update dependencies
- Review user permissions
- Audit admin access

#### Quarterly:
- Security penetration testing
- Code security review
- Infrastructure security audit
- Backup and recovery testing

### 7. Emergency Response

#### If credentials are compromised:
1. **Immediately** rotate all affected credentials
2. Review access logs for suspicious activity
3. Notify affected users if necessary
4. Update security measures
5. Document the incident

#### Contact Information:
- Security Team: security@bookworldindia.com
- Emergency: +91-XXXXXXXXXX

### 8. Compliance

#### Data Protection:
- Follow GDPR guidelines for EU users
- Implement data retention policies
- Provide data export/deletion capabilities
- Maintain audit logs

#### Payment Security:
- Use PCI DSS compliant payment processors
- Never store payment information
- Implement secure payment flows
- Regular security assessments
